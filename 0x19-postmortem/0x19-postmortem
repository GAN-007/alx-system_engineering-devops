Impact: Users were unable to access the website, and those who managed to access it experienced slow load times. Approximately 80% of users were affected.

Root Cause: A surge in traffic to the website caused the server to crash.

Timeline:

2:00 PM: Issue detected when the website started to load slowly.
2:05 PM: The monitoring system alerted the engineering team.
2:10 PM: The team started investigating the issue, assuming it was due to a network problem.
2:20 PM: After verifying that the network was not the issue, the team started investigating the server.
2:30 PM: The team identified that the server had crashed due to high traffic.
2:40 PM: The team attempted to restart the server, but it failed to come back online.
3:00 PM: The incident was escalated to senior management and the development team.
3:30 PM: The website was restored after the development team deployed a new server.
Root Cause and Resolution:

The root cause of the issue was a surge in traffic to the website. The server was not equipped to handle the sudden influx of users, causing it to crash. The team resolved the issue by deploying a new server that was better equipped to handle high traffic.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

To prevent similar issues from occurring in the future, the following measures will be taken:

Upgrade server capacity to handle high traffic.
Implement load balancing to distribute traffic evenly among servers.
Conduct load testing to simulate high traffic scenarios and identify potential issues.
Implement an automated failover system to ensure that the website remains available even if one server fails.
Tasks to address the issue:

Purchase and install new servers with higher capacity.
Configure load balancing to distribute traffic evenly.
Set up load testing to identify potential issues.
Implement an automated failover system.
